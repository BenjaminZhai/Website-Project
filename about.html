One is that she is the daughter of Zeus and the Titan Dione. This would mean that she is also the half sibling of many different gods. However, the other myth states that she srpung up out of the foam of Ouranos when he died and fell into the sea. This would technically make her the sibling of the Titans, which include Cronus, Rhea, and many others. This would also technically make her the oldest in the current pantheon. She is married to the god Hephaestus, but she doesn't really like him, and has affairs all the time with Ares. Her godly children include Harmonia, the twin gods of fear and panic Phobos and Deimos, and Eros, the god of love.

His parents are Zeus, and the mortal princess, Semele. Out of jealousy, Hera, Zeus' wife, convinced the pregnant Semele to ask Zeus to show his true form. Zeus begrudgingly agreed, but since his true form was too powerful for a mortal, Semele vaporized. Zeus, however, saved his son, by sewing him into his leg, until he was ready to be born. He is married to the former princess of Crete, and now divine Ariadne, who was abandoned by her previous husband, Theseus. He had nine children with her: 	Priapus, Hymen, Thoas, Staphylus, Oenopion, Comus, Phthonus, the Graces, and Deianira.

    <h2>Hades (Left Out)</h2>
            <p>Hades is a ancient greek god. He is the god of the underworld and death. He was left out of the 12 olympians because he had to take care of the underworld, so he couldn't really leave his post. Also, since he is the god of death, the other gods weren't to fond of him. He is called Pluto by the Romans. He is the oldest out of his brothers, Zeus and Posiedon. He is the child of Cronus and Rhea. He is married to the goddess of the spring, Persephone. He has some children, though they are all obsucre. His weapon is called a bident, which is basically a trident but with two prongs.</p>
